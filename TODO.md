# Things I hadn't enough time to fix/implement/care about
- enemies can easily be held at bay by dodging indefinitely
- there are still not enough skills and skill variety
- there's no to very little balance to the game

# Things that would be nice to add eventually
- a health bar for enemies
- player inventory for usable items
- floors with a trader for item/skill purchases
- eventually have skills ~~be lootable from enemies and~~ buyable from a trader
- bosses after every 10th floor
- smooth difficulty scaling up to infinite floors
- a cool title screen
