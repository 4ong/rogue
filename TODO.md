# Todos until 1.0

## UI
- proper start and end screen (stats for win/loss)
- fancier stats panel window with colors
- more useful log messages
- indicate enemy stats and tile properties through hover window

## Enemies
- advanced pathfinding logic to move enemies into better positions
- different enemy types with varying stats
- improved enemy spawn placement
- enemy ranged combat to prevent player dodging?

## Map
- better exit placement (really in corners)

## Skills
- come up with lots of skills and implement their unique properties if necessary
- dynamically require all skill files in `skills/` directory
- skill selection before the game starts (pick 5 out of how many I can come up with)
- alternatively: pick 5 random skills for the game
- improved handling for self targetting skills (no target selection necessary)

## Game Logic
- make player health points persistent across floors


# Things that would be nice to add eventually
- player inventory for usable items
- floors with a trader for item/skill purchases
- eventually have skills be lootable from enemies and buyable from a trader
- bosses after every 10th floor
- smooth difficulty scaling up to infinite floors
- a cool title screen
